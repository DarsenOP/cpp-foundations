Progress Report â€“ Task Manager CLI (Day 5)

ðŸ“… Date: 02/05/25
ðŸ•’ Time Spent: 6-8h
âœ… What I Did Today

    Improved Input Parsing & Flag Handling
         Refactored flag extraction to support multiple values (e.g., multiple --tags entries).
         Ensured proper validation for required flags (e.g., --id for edit, delete, complete).
         Used unordered_map for efficient flag storage and validation.

    Enhanced Task Search Functionality
         Implemented case-insensitive multi-word search for descriptions (--description).
         Improved tag filtering (--tags) by ensuring exact matches but case-insensitive comparisons.
         Refactored search logic to efficiently handle both filters simultaneously.
         Optimized hidden task tracking using m_hidden_count to improve List() performance.

    Improved Task Display & Formatting
         Dynamically calculated column widths in List() for better table alignment.
         Filtered out hidden tasks when displaying search results.
         Optimized whitespace and table borders for readability.

    Refactored Code for Efficiency & Readability
         Replaced manual loops with std::ranges functions where applicable.
         Optimized search conditions to reduce redundant checks.
         Refactored ToLower() usage by applying it early in processing instead of per comparison.
         Ensured proper flag validation before executing commands, avoiding unnecessary computations.

    Improved Error Handling & User Feedback
         Refined error messages for missing or invalid flag values.
         Added more specific validation for date formats in --due.
         Ensured search provides meaningful output even if no matches are found.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

     ðŸ”¹ Implement Task Persistence â€“ Save & load tasks from a file.
     ðŸ”¹ Add Sorting Functionality â€“ Sort tasks by due date, priority, or ID.
     ðŸ”¹ Improve Task Filtering â€“ Filter tasks based on status (pending or completed).
     ðŸ”¹ Optimize Command Execution â€“ Minimize redundant flag checks and enhance UI feedback.
