Progress Report â€“ Task Manager CLI (Day 7)

ðŸ“… Date: 02/07/25
ðŸ•’ Time Spent: 6-8h
âœ… What I Did Today
    Import & Export System

        Implemented task persistence using file I/O (import/export).
        Supported three formats: CSV, JSON, and TXT for easy data portability.
        Ensured robust error handling for malformed or missing files.
        Duplicate ID prevention when importing, avoiding conflicts with existing tasks.
        Auto-adjusted m_prev_id to prevent ID collisions after importing.

    Configuration System

        Introduced config file (config.json) to store user settings.
        Added --default-priority setting to define a default priority for new tasks.
        Ensured the config file is created on first run if missing.
        Config values are validated before being applied to prevent incorrect settings.

    Help System Overhaul

        Rewritten Help() function for better clarity and organization.
        Clearly structured commands into categories:
            Task Management (add, delete, complete, edit)
            Viewing & Searching (list, search, filter, sort)
            Tag Management (tag --list, tag --id X --add/remove tag)
            General (help, exit)
        Added detailed examples for each command to assist new users.
        Improved error messages and hints for invalid flag usage.

    File Path Fix for Exports

        Ensured that exported files are saved in a designated folder (~/Documents/TaskManagerCLI).
        Fixed the issue where files were always saved in the build directory.
        Used environment expansion (std::filesystem) to correctly interpret "~" for user home directory.

    Code Optimization & Refactoring

        Streamlined import/export logic, reducing redundant parsing code.
        Improved error messages for invalid IDs, priorities, and file names.
        Refactored flag parsing logic for better readability and maintainability.
        Further optimized tag system to prevent unnecessary reallocation.

    Aliases

        Added aliases (shortcuts) for commands and flags like --d for --description or exp for export

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

    ðŸ”¹ Further Code Cleanup â€“ Improve maintainability & documentation.
    ðŸ”¹ Potential Enhancements â€“ Future polish & bug fixes if needed.

ðŸš€ Project Status: Task Manager CLI is fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
