Progress Report â€“ File Manager CLI (Day 1)

ðŸ“… Date: 02/09/25
ðŸ•’ Time Spent: 5-6h
âœ… What I Did Today

    File System Entity Design
        Defined the core attributes common to all entities: ID, name, permissions, created at, and attributes.
        Decided on a base class (SystemEntity) with two derived classes: FileSystemEntity (for files and directories) and AccountEntity (for users and groups).
        Grouped file and directory classes under FileSystemEntity, and user and group classes under AccountEntity.

    Logging Setup
        Finalized a logging system using spdlog with a custom logger to handle different log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
        Implemented logging for various exceptions and inputs.
        Added a logging mechanism to track errors based on exception types and included timestamped logs for clarity.

    Command Processor
        Designed a CommandProcessor to handle user input commands.
        Implemented parsing, normalization, and error handling for input strings, including spaces and quoted arguments.
        Incorporated a Trim() and NormalizeSpaces() system to clean up input before processing.

    Exception Handling
        Implemented custom exceptions (EmptyInputException, NonIsolatedQuotedArgumentException, etc.) with tailored messages and logging levels.
        Added exception handling in the CommandProcessor to trigger appropriate responses based on command validity.

    Manager Class
        Created the Manager class as the entry point for the file manager.
        Integrated exception handling and user input processing into the Manager::Start() loop.
        Log error levels and handle invalid inputs with an option to retry for specific errors (like empty input).

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

    ðŸ”¹ Start implementing specific attributes for the File, Directory, User, and Group classes.
    ðŸ”¹ Begin handling file I/O operations for reading and writing to simulated directories and files.
    ðŸ”¹ Continue improving exception handling and logging functionality.

ðŸš€ Project Status: Initial setup and foundational work are complete, now progressing to entity and file handling logic! ðŸŽ‰
