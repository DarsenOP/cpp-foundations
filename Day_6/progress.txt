Progress Report â€“ Task Manager CLI (Day 6)

âœ… What I Did Today

    Advanced Search, Filter & Sorting
        Fully implemented search with multi-word support for descriptions and exact match for tags.
        Optimized filtering for priority, status, and date ranges (--due & --to).
        Added sorting (sort --by priority --order asc/desc) with dynamic comparison functions.
        Ensured sorting persists across sessions unless manually re-sorted.

    Tag Management System
        Implemented tag manipulation (tag --id X --add tag1, tag --id X --remove tag1).
        Added tag --list to display all unique tags in a formatted column view.
        Optimized tag storage using an unordered_map to track tag occurrences efficiently.
        Ensured tag removal updates global tag storage correctly.

    Undo System (History Tracking)
        Implemented undo to revert the last action (add, delete, edit, tag modifications).
        Used a deque to maintain an action history, automatically trimming older entries.
        Limited history to 50 actions to prevent memory bloat.
        Improved error handling when attempting to undo with an empty history.

    Code Optimization & Refactoring
        Streamlined m_hidden_count logic to reduce unnecessary count_if operations.
        Consolidated redundant flag validation logic for better efficiency.
        Improved function structure by breaking down large functions into smaller helper functions.
        Used std::ranges and structured bindings to enhance code clarity and performance.

    Improved Error Handling & User Feedback
        Added detailed error messages for invalid input (e.g., sort --by without a value).
        Ensured quoted text validation to prevent empty or whitespace-only descriptions.
        Enhanced error feedback for negative or invalid task IDs.
        Standardized console messages for clarity and consistency.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

    ðŸ”¹ Task Persistence â€“ Save & load tasks from a file (export/import).
    ðŸ”¹ User Configuration â€“ Custom settings (config --default-priority medium).
    ðŸ”¹ Command Aliases â€“ Support shorthand commands (e.g., ls for list).
    ðŸ”¹ Further Code Cleanup â€“ Improve maintainability & documentation.
